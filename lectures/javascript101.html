add onload=""; as an element in any tag

variable:
  var foo = ...;
  - only 3 types of variables: number, string and boolean
  var foo = ["", "", ""];
  - able to push element into an array in javascript!
    + push: add to the end
    + unshift: add to the begin
    + pop: delete the last item
    + shift: delete the first item
    + concat: combine 2 arrays together
    + pets.join(" stuff in between ") combine all elementals in an array together.
    + pets.length: similar to java

function:
  function foo() {  }
  - very similar to java. Except that you have to declare it as function.

condition:
  if () {}
  else {}
  switch () {
    case "": ... break; case "": ... break; default: ...;
  }
  "||" or "&&" and "!" not
  - very similar with java.

loop:
  while () {};
  do {} while ();

debugging:
  console.log("to be or not to be");
