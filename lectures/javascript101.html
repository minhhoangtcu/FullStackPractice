add onload=""; as an element in any tag

variable:
  var foo = ...;
  - only 3 types of variables: number, string and boolean
  var foo = ["", "", ""];
  - array
  - able to push element into an array in javascript!
    + push: add to the end
    + unshift: add to the begin
    + pop: delete the last item
    + shift: delete the first item
    + concat: combine 2 arrays together
    + join(" stuff in between ") combine all elementals in an array together.
    + length: similar to java
    + sort
    + indexOf
    + slice()(start pos, end pos) similar to Array.rangeOf
    + reverse()
    + lastIndexOf()
    + splice(start pos, end pos) this affect original array.
    + forEach( do stuff ); it will execute a function for each value in the array.
      It will put 3 inputs into the function: the element, index, and the array.
    + map(); same as forEach, but it will return a result.

function:
  function foo() {  }
  - very similar to java. Except that you have to declare it as function.

condition:
  if () {}
  else {}
  switch () {
    case "": ... break; case "": ... break; default: ...;
  }
  "||" or "&&" and "!" not
  - very similar with java.

loop:
  while () {};
  do {} while ();
  for (...;...;...) {}
  for (... in array): gives index or left hand side.
  for (... of array): gives the actual value

debugging:
  console.log("to be or not to be");
